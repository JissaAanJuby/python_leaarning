# 🐍 Python Learning Journey

Welcome to my Python learning repository! This repo contains my daily progress, notes, and practice code as I explore Python programming.

## 📅 Day 1 – Introduction to Programming & Flowcharts

**Topics Covered:**

- ✅ Learnt what **programming** is and why it's important.
- 🔍 Understood the **difference between a compiler and an interpreter**.
- 🧠 Explored the concept of an **algorithm** – a step-by-step solution to a problem.
- 📝 Studied **flowcharts** and the different **symbols** used:
  - Terminator (Start/End)
  - Process
  - Input/Output
  - Decision
- 💡 Practiced **drawing flowcharts** for different types of problems.

**Reflection:**

This session helped me understand how to logically plan and visualize problems before writing code. Flowcharts made it easier to think like a programmer.

## 📅 Day 2 – Python Generations, Features, Tokens & Operators

**Topics Covered:**

- 🕰️ Learnt about the **first**, **second**, and **third generations** of programming languages and how Python fits into the third generation.
- 🐍 Explored the **features of Python** such as simplicity, readability, and versatility across domains.
- 🧩 Studied the **functional units of Python**, including how Python executes instructions and organizes data.
- 🔤 Understood all the **tokens in Python**, including:
  - **Keywords**, **Identifiers**, **Literals**, **Operators**, and **Punctuators**
- ➗ Learnt and revised different types of **operators**:
  - **Arithmetic Operators** for calculations
  - **Logical Operators** like `and`, `or`, `not` for conditions
  - **Identity Operators** like `is`, `is not` for comparing memory references
  - **Comparison Operators** like `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<` for value comparisons

**Reflection:**

This session helped me build a clear understanding of Python’s structure and logic. Learning how Python handles different types of operations and tokens makes it easier to write efficient and error-free code.

## 📅 Day 3 – Conditional Statements in Python

**Topics Covered:**

- 🧠 Learnt about **conditional statements** and how they help make decisions in a program.
- ✅ Practiced using:
  - `if` statements for simple one-way decisions.
  - `if-else` for two-way branching.
  - `elif` for multiple conditions.
  - **Nested if** statements for comparing multiple values in stages.

**Programs Implemented:**

- Check if a value is `True` or `False` using simple if-else.
- Determine if a person is a **minor or major** based on their age.
- Identify if a number is **positive or negative**.
- Find the **bigger** or **smaller** of two numbers.
- Check if a number is **odd or even**.
- Determine if a given year is a **leap year**.
- Calculate **exam grades** based on marks using chained `elif` statements.
- Compare **three numbers** to find the largest using both `if-elif-else` and **nested if** structures.

**Reflection:**

This session improved my ability to control program flow with conditions. Writing different real-life decision-making programs helped reinforce the logic behind using `if`, `else`, and `elif` effectively.
