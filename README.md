# 🐍 Python Learning Journey

Welcome to my Python learning repository! This repo contains my daily progress, notes, and practice code as I explore Python programming.

---

## 📅 Day 1 – Introduction to Programming & Flowcharts

**Topics Covered:**

- ✅ Learnt what **programming** is and why it's important.
- 🔍 Understood the **difference between a compiler and an interpreter**.
- 🧠 Explored the concept of an **algorithm** – a step-by-step solution to a problem.
- 📝 Studied **flowcharts** and the different **symbols** used:
  - Terminator (Start/End)
  - Process
  - Input/Output
  - Decision
- 💡 Practiced **drawing flowcharts** for different types of problems.

**Reflection:**

This session helped me understand how to logically plan and visualize problems before writing code. Flowcharts made it easier to think like a programmer.

## 📅 Day 2 – Python Generations, Features, Tokens & Operators

**Topics Covered:**

- 🕰️ Learnt about the **first**, **second**, and **third generations** of programming languages and how Python fits into the third generation.
- 🐍 Explored the **features of Python** such as simplicity, readability, and versatility across domains.
- 🧩 Studied the **functional units of Python**, including how Python executes instructions and organizes data.
- 🔤 Understood all the **tokens in Python**, including:
  - **Keywords**, **Identifiers**, **Literals**, **Operators**, and **Punctuators**
- ➗ Learnt and revised different types of **operators**:
  - **Arithmetic Operators** for calculations
  - **Logical Operators** like `and`, `or`, `not` for conditions
  - **Identity Operators** like `is`, `is not` for comparing memory references
  - **Comparison Operators** like `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<` for value comparisons

**Reflection:**

This session helped me build a clear understanding of Python’s structure and logic. Learning how Python handles different types of operations and tokens makes it easier to write efficient and error-free code.

## 📅 Day 3 – Conditional Statements in Python

**Topics Covered:**

- 🧠 Learnt about **conditional statements** and how they help make decisions in a program.
- ✅ Practiced using:
  - `if` statements for simple one-way decisions.
  - `if-else` for two-way branching.
  - `elif` for multiple conditions.
  - **Nested if** statements for comparing multiple values in stages.

**Programs Implemented:**

- Check if a value is `True` or `False` using simple if-else.
- Determine if a person is a **minor or major** based on their age.
- Identify if a number is **positive or negative**.
- Find the **bigger** or **smaller** of two numbers.
- Check if a number is **odd or even**.
- Determine if a given year is a **leap year**.
- Calculate **exam grades** based on marks using chained `elif` statements.
- Compare **three numbers** to find the largest using both `if-elif-else` and **nested if** structures.

**Reflection:**

This session improved my ability to control program flow with conditions. Writing different real-life decision-making programs helped reinforce the logic behind using `if`, `else`, and `elif` effectively.

# Day 4 – Python Loops and Iterations 🐍🔁

This folder contains Python practice programs from Day 4 of my learning journey. The focus was on mastering `for` loops and `while` loops through small hands-on examples.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

### ✅ `for` Loops
- Print a string multiple times
- Print index with a string
- Range with custom start, end, step
- Odd and even number printing using `for`
- Squares of numbers
- Fibonacci sequence (up to a value)

### ✅ `while` Loops
- Count from 1 to 10
- Print odd/even numbers using `while`
- Sum of natural numbers using `while` and `for`
- Factorial calculation using both loops

---

## 📂 Programs Included

| Program | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `print("jissa")` | Simple string output |
| `for i in range(11)` | Looping and printing strings |
| `for i in range(1,n+1)` | Counting from 1 to n |
| Odd/Even filters | Using `%2==1` or `%2==0` |
| Squares of 1–10 | `i*i` |
| Fibonacci Series | Loop to generate values up to 233 |
| Sum of N Numbers | Using both `for` and `while` |
| Factorial | Both `for` and `while` approaches |
| Factors of a Number | Divisibility check from 1 to n |

# Day 5 – Python Conditional Logic and Looping Problems 🔁🧠

This folder contains Python practice programs from Day 5 of my learning journey. The focus was on using `for` loops with conditional statements to solve practical problems involving comparisons, discounts, and classification of numbers.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

### ✅ Conditional Statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Used for comparisons, decision-making, and calculating discounts.

### ✅ Loops with Input
- Taking multiple inputs inside a loop for comparisons and summations.

### ✅ Number Classification
- Even vs Odd numbers and digits
- Sum based on condition
- Maximum/Minimum identification

## 📂 Programs Included

| Program | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Biggest of 10 numbers | Takes 10 inputs and finds the largest |
| Smallest of 10 numbers | Takes 10 inputs and finds the smallest |
| Smallest of n numbers | Takes `n` inputs and finds the smallest |
| Biggest of n numbers | Takes `n` inputs and finds the largest |
| Discount calculation | Based on total purchase value with slabs |
| Sum of odd and even numbers | Separates and sums inputs by parity |
| Count odd/even digits | Counts even and odd digits up to `n` |
